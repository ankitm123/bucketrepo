# Bucket Repo

This is a lightweight artifacts repository with low memory footprint which can be used as a minimal replacement for 
[Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype). It is able to cache artifacts from a remote repository
on a local filesystem volume and also to store them on a cloud storage bucket via [go-cloud](https://github.com/google/go-cloud/).

It can be deployed either as a side-car container to a Kubernetes build pod or as a standalone service.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

The [default configuration](config/config.yaml) enables only the local file cache:
```YAML
http:
    addr: ":8080"

storage:
    enabled: false
    bucket_url: "gs://bucketrepo"

cache:
    base_dir: "/tmp/bucketrepo"

repositories:
    - url: "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2"
    - url: "http://uk.maven.org/maven2/"
```

The header (for example Bearer token authentication) and timeout can be modified for every remote repository:
```YAML
...

repositories:
    - url: "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2"
      timeout: "30s"
    - url: "http://uk.maven.org/maven2/"
    - url: "http://my.private.maven.repo"
      timeout: "10s"
      header:
          Authorization: "Bearer <Token>"
```

The cloud storage can be enabled by providing a bucket URL:
```YAML
storage:
    enabled: true
    bucket_url: "gs://mybucket"
    # if necessary is possible to use Path prefix
    prefix: "myfolder" 
```

Also the TLS and basic authentication can be configured with:
```YAML
http:
    addr: ":8080"
    https: true
    crt: "/certs/domain.crt"
    key: "/certs/domain.key"
    username: "myuser"
    password: "mypassword"
```
Note that the basic authentication is turned off when HTTPS is disabled.

### Supported Artifacts

This repository has been tested with `maven` and `helm` tools, but it can also store other artifacts.

### Installing

#### Kubernetes

The repository service can be installed in a Kubernetes cluster using helm. First, you need to add the jenkins-x chart repository to your helm repositories:

```sh
helm repo add jenkins-x http://chartmuseum.jenkins-x.io
helm repo update
```
You can now install the chart with:
```
helm install jenkins-x/bucketrepo --name bucketrepo
```

##### S3 compatible buckets

When using an S3 compatible bucket deployed locally (like Minio, Ceph...) you might need to configure bucketrepo to trust the SSL certificate for the bucket.

In order to that, you can add `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` to envSecrets with path of the CA file, and mount that file using extraConfig that looks like this:
```
extraConfig:
  ca-certificates.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
```
the certificate can be retrieved using:
```
kubectl -n minio get secrets minio1-tls -o yaml | ksd (public.crt)
```

the bucketUrl should look like this:
```
"s3://bucketrepo?endpoint=https://minio.minio.svc.cluster.local&s3ForcePathStyle=true&region=us-east-1"
```

#### Locally
The repository can be started in a docker container usinged the [latest released](https://github.com/jenkins-x/bucketrepo/releases) image:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/config:/config -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/jenkinsxio/bucketrepo:0.1.12 -config-path=/config
```

Or it can be built and run with:
```bash
make build
bin/bucketrepo -config-path=config -log-level=debug
```

### Maven Configuration

`bucketrepo`can be configured as a mirror by adding the following in `~/.m2/settings.xml` file:
```XML
<settings>
<mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>bucketrepo</id>
      <name>bucketrepo- mirror</name>
      <url>http://localhost:8080/bucketrepo/</url>
      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
</settings>
```

And as a repository by adding the following in the `pom.xml` file:
```XML
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>bucketrepo</id>
        <url>http://localhost:8080/bucketrepo/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
        <id>snapshots</id>
        <url>http://localhost:8080/bucketrepo/deploy/maven-snapshots/</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
    <repository>
        <id>releases</id>
        <url>http://localhost:8080/bucketrepo/deploy/maven-releases/</url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```
